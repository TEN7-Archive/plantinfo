  - If you have a question about plants that our databases canâ€™t answer, don't despair! If you live in Minnesota, visit the University of Minnesota Extension's Gardening Information page. If you live anywhere in the USA you can ask a Master Gardener your question through the national extension system.
  - "Another option is to contact or visit your local library or a botanical or horticultural library. The Council on Botanical & Horticultural Libraries (CBHL) maintains a list of relevant libraries on their website: Botany, Horticulture and Natural Sciences Libraries, as does the European Botanical & Horticultural Libraries Group (EBHL)."
  - If you are affiliated with the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, you can submit your question to a librarian through AskUs.
